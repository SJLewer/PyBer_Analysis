# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
 ### Part I:  
 Summarize the differences in ride-sharing data among different city types during 2019, based on:
   1. Total Rides
   1. Total Drivers
   1. Total Fares
   1. Average Fare per Ride 
   1. Average Fare per Driver
   1. Total Fare by City Type

 ### Part II: 
 Based on the results, provide recommendations for consideration by PyBer decision-makers to address ride-sharing disparities.

## Results:

 _Total Rides_: Not too surprising, total rides in urban cities (1,625) far exceeded suburban (625) and rural (125) cities.
 
 _Total Drivers_: While the total number of drivers in rural areas were the lowest among the city types, they were the busiest (1.6 rides/driver). Urban drivers were the least busy (0.67 rides/driver).
 
 _Average Fare per Ride_: Although the total number of rides in rural areas were the lowest, the average fare per ride was the highest ($34.62) compared to the other city types.  This suggests the rides in rural cities were for long distances.  Conversely, in urban cities, the average fare per ride was much lower, indicating rides were for short distances.
 
 _Average Fare per Driver_: Drivers in rural areas produced the highest average fare per driver ($55.49).  Drivers in urban areas generated the lowest average fare per driver ($16.57).
 
 _Total Fares_: Despite the lowest average fare per ride and per driver, the high volume of rides contributed to urban cities producing the highest total revenue ($39,854.38).
 
 _Total Fare by City Type_: In the graph below, all three city types experienced a peak in total fares generated the third week of February. During March, Suburban and Rural total fares generated week-to-week were fairly steady, whereas the weekly total fares for urban cities were volatile.

## Summary/Recommendations:
Below are recommendations to address some of the disparities among city types and improve profits.

 1. Further assess ride-sharing demand in rural cities.  If there is room for expansion, consider hiring more drivers in rural cities.
 
 1. There appears to be an over-saturation of drivers in urban cities.  Consider reducing the number of urban city drivers or reassigning them to rural cities. 
 
 1. Further analyze weekly trends to align driver schedules.  For example, as shown above, there was a peak for all city types during the third week of February, followed by a lull the end of February.  Assuming these trends correlate with rider demand, schedule additional drivers during the "peak weeks" and fewer drivers during the lull times.
